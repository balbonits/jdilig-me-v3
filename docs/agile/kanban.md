## Kanban Principles

### Core Rules
1. **Respect WIP limits** - Never exceed, finish before starting new
2. **Focus on flow** - Minimize context switching
3. **Pull, don't push** - Work pulls when capacity allows
4. **Continuous improvement** - Regular retrospectives

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- Starting too much work (high WIP)
- Ignoring blockers
- Skipping quality gates
- Working on wrong priorities

### Current Experiments
- Testing 3-item WIP limit for solo dev
- Daily flow reviews for blocker identification
- Smaller batch sizes for faster feedback
