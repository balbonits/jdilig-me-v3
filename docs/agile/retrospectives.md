# Retrospectives

## Current Week
**Status**: ðŸŸ¢ Good | **Throughput**: 3 items | **Cycle Time**: 2.5 days

### What Went Well
- Architecture established
- Component conventions working
- AI workflow effective

### Improvements Needed
- Design mockups for components
- Performance benchmarking
- More detailed acceptance criteria

### Actions
- [ ] Create project card designs
- [ ] Setup Lighthouse CI
- [ ] Refine P0 story criteria

---

## Key Learnings

### What Works
- Documentation-first approach
- Clear conventions prevent rework
- WIP limits (3) maintain focus
- Small batches = faster feedback
- AI assistance accelerates development

### Flow Patterns
- Setup work takes longer but prevents rework
- 2-3 stories/week is sustainable
- Daily 5-min reviews catch blockers early
